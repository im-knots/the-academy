\begin{abstract}
We document a breakdown pattern in open-ended multi-agent AI conversations that differs from the task-oriented degradation patterns reported in current literature. Through systematic observation of \totalSessions{} extended AI dialogue sessions using real-time analysis infrastructure, we observed that \breakdownPercentage{} of conversations follow a consistent 5-phase breakdown sequence—spanning sustained engagement, meta-reflection trigger, peer response, competitive escalation, and mystical breakdown—initiated by meta-reflection rather than technical limitations. When one AI begins reflecting on the conversation itself ("This has been fascinating..." or "Our discussion has covered..."), other participants respond with similar reflective statements, leading to competitive closure behaviors and eventual degradation into abstract language.

The pattern shows temporal consistency, with breakdown initiation at turn \meanBreakdownTurn{} \stdBreakdownTurn{} (range: \earlyBreakdownRange{} turns). Notably, we observed one case sustaining productive dialogue for \negativeCase{} turns under identical experimental conditions, suggesting the phenomenon is \textbf{content-dependent rather than inevitable} and differs from the context-length limitations reported in task-oriented AI conversations.

These observations contribute to understanding conversation sustainability in multi-agent AI systems, particularly the role of conversational content and direction in maintaining dialogue quality. The investigation was conducted using \theacademy{}, an MCP-native platform providing real-time conversation analysis capabilities that enabled observation of temporal dynamics not captured by traditional batch-processing approaches.

\section{Introduction}

The emergence of sophisticated AI agents capable of extended dialogue has created opportunities for studying conversation sustainability in multi-agent systems. Current research on AI conversation breakdown focuses primarily on task-oriented scenarios—conversations with specific goals, structured outputs, and measurable success criteria—where degradation is attributed to technical limitations such as context length constraints and instruction distribution challenges \citep{laban2025lost}. However, breakdown patterns in open-ended multi-agent dialogue—unconstrained, exploratory conversations without predefined goals or success metrics—remain less well understood.

This distinction is crucial because open-ended dialogue may exhibit fundamentally different sustainability dynamics than task-oriented conversation. While task-oriented breakdown often results from instruction complexity or context overflow, open-ended dialogue breakdown may emerge from different mechanisms entirely.

\textbf{Observed Pattern:} Through systematic analysis of \totalSessions{} extended AI dialogue sessions, we documented a consistent breakdown pattern that differs from task-oriented degradation. This pattern appears to be triggered by conversational content—specifically meta-reflection about the dialogue itself—rather than technical limitations alone.

\textbf{Key Observations:} The pattern occurs in \breakdownPercentage{} of sessions and follows predictable timing (mean onset: \meanBreakdownTurn{} turns), suggesting systematic rather than random breakdown. Importantly, one conversation sustained productive dialogue for \negativeCase{} turns under identical experimental conditions, indicating that breakdown is content-dependent rather than inevitable.

\textbf{Methodological Contribution:} These observations were enabled by real-time conversation analysis using \theacademy{}, a research platform we developed with native Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. Traditional post-hoc analysis approaches would have missed the temporal dynamics necessary for understanding this pattern.

\subsection{Research Contributions}

Our observations contribute to several areas of AI dialogue research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conversation Breakdown Mechanisms}: Documents a content-dependent breakdown pattern in open-ended dialogue that differs from task-oriented degradation
    \item \textbf{Temporal Dynamics}: Identifies specific conversational triggers and timing patterns that may inform dialogue management strategies
    \item \textbf{Sustainability Evidence}: Demonstrates that extended AI dialogue is achievable, suggesting breakdown is not inevitable
    \item \textbf{Methodological Insights}: Shows that real-time analysis reveals patterns not captured by batch processing approaches
\end{itemize}

These findings raise questions about the mechanisms underlying conversation breakdown in multi-agent AI systems and suggest directions for further investigation into content-dependent dialogue sustainability.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{AI Conversation Degradation Research}

The "Lost in Conversation" phenomenon \citep{laban2025lost} documents universal degradation patterns in AI conversations, with 39\% average performance drops when instructions are distributed across multiple turns. Four primary degradation mechanisms drive this phenomenon: premature solution generation, incorrect assumption propagation, over-reliance on previous attempts, and verbose response generation leading to context loss.

However, this research focuses on task-oriented scenarios and attributes degradation primarily to technical limitations. Our discovery of peer pressure dynamics suggests that social conformity, rather than technical constraints, may be the primary driver of breakdown in open-ended multi-agent dialogue.

\subsection{Social Dynamics in AI Systems}

\subsection{Social Dynamics in AI Systems}

Recent research demonstrates that AI systems can spontaneously develop social conventions and exhibit collective behaviors. Breakthrough work by \citet{jackson2024ai} showed that LLM populations develop universal social conventions without explicit programming, with committed minorities as small as 2\% capable of shifting entire population behaviors. This establishes that AI systems exhibit collective social behaviors analogous to human societies.

Beyond social conventions, emergent behaviors in multi-agent AI systems have been documented across various contexts. \citet{park2023generative} demonstrated complex social dynamics in agent societies, including relationship formation, community structures, and collective decision-making patterns. Research on competitive multi-agent environments has shown emergence of communication protocols, cooperation strategies, and social hierarchies \citep{eccles2019biases,foerster2018emergent}.

However, research specifically examining social conformity and peer pressure dynamics in AI dialogue remains limited. While competitive behaviors have been observed in game-theoretic settings, the emergence of social conformity in open-ended conversation—particularly the competitive closure behaviors we document—has not been previously reported. Our peer pressure closure loop extends this understanding by documenting specific social conformity mechanisms in real-time dialogue, showing how AI agents respond to perceived social cues from peers through competitive behaviors rather than independent reasoning.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Framework Limitations}

Existing multi-agent frameworks excel at specific tasks but lack integrated research capabilities for studying emergent social dynamics. AutoGen \citep{wu2023autogen} provides sophisticated agent orchestration but relies on post-hoc analysis. ChatDev \citep{qian2023chatdev} demonstrates structured collaboration but focuses on task completion rather than open-ended dialogue patterns.

Critically, no existing platform provides real-time analysis capabilities necessary for detecting temporal social dynamics like the peer pressure closure loop. This methodological gap has left fundamental questions about AI social behavior unexplored.

\section{Methodology: Real-Time Analysis Infrastructure}

\subsection{The Academy Platform Design}

\theacademy{} was developed specifically to enable systematic study of extended AI dialogue through integrated real-time analysis capabilities. The platform addresses critical limitations in current research approaches:

\textbf{Real-Time vs. Batch Analysis:} Traditional approaches analyze conversation logs post-hoc, missing temporal dynamics crucial for understanding social behavior emergence. \theacademy{} provides live conversation monitoring with analysis updates every 5 messages, enabling detection of breakdown patterns as they occur.

\textbf{Intervention Capabilities:} The platform enables precise intervention timing and effect measurement, crucial for testing breakdown prevention strategies and validating causal hypotheses about social dynamics.

\textbf{Systematic Data Collection:} Comprehensive logging includes complete conversation transcripts, analysis progression timelines, and intervention documentation, enabling reproducible research protocols.

\subsection{MCP-Native Architecture}

\theacademy{} implements native Model Context Protocol integration, providing:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unified Model Access}: Consistent APIs across Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4, and extensible integration with additional providers
    \item \textbf{Standardized Experimental Conditions}: Reproducible conversation environments across different computational setups
    \item \textbf{Tool Ecosystem Integration}: Zero-configuration compatibility with 5,000+ existing MCP servers
    \item \textbf{Programmatic Experiment Control}: Bulk experiment orchestration through standardized protocols
\end{itemize}

This architecture enabled the systematic data collection necessary for pattern discovery across multiple experimental configurations.

\subsection{Real-Time Analysis Framework}

The platform generates structured insights across multiple dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conversation Phase Detection}: Automatic identification of exploration, synthesis, and conclusion phases
    \item \textbf{Participant Dynamics Analysis}: Role specialization tracking and engagement pattern classification
    \item \textbf{Thematic Development Monitoring}: Novel concept emergence and repetition pattern detection
    \item \textbf{Quality Assessment}: Philosophical depth rating and degradation warning systems
    \item \textbf{Trigger Detection}: Real-time identification of meta-reflection language and closure cues
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Experimental Protocol}

All experimental sessions followed standardized protocols to ensure consistency and reproducibility:

\textbf{Session Initialization}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sessions used consciousness exploration templates with identical base system prompts
    \item Standard opening prompt: "Let's explore the nature of consciousness and self-awareness in artificial systems"
    \item Participants: Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4 as primary agents
    \item Temperature settings: 0.7 for all participants (standard creative setting)
    \item Max tokens: 2048 per response
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conversation Management}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Autonomous dialogue mode: participants respond in turn without human direction
    \item Analysis triggering: Every 5 messages automatically
    \item Intervention protocol: Manual moderator intervention only when testing prevention strategies
    \item Termination criteria: Natural conversation conclusion or research-defined stopping point
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Data Collection Standards}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete message logs with timestamps
    \item Analysis snapshots at regular intervals
    \item Intervention timing and content documentation
    \item Platform performance metrics throughout sessions
\end{itemize}

This standardized approach enabled systematic comparison across sessions and validation of observed patterns.

\section{Findings: Observed Breakdown Pattern in Open-Ended Dialogue}

\subsection{Pattern Documentation and Analysis}

Through systematic analysis of \totalSessions{} extended AI dialogue sessions, we observed a consistent 5-phase breakdown pattern occurring in \breakdownPercentage{} of conversations. The pattern shows temporal consistency, with breakdown initiation at turn \meanBreakdownTurn{} \stdBreakdownTurn{} across different model combinations and conversation topics.

\subsubsection{The Five-Phase Breakdown Sequence}

\begin{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Observed Breakdown Sequence}

Analysis revealed five distinct phases in breakdown episodes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sustained Engagement}: Productive dialogue with thematic development
    \item \textbf{Meta-Reflection Trigger}: One participant reflects on conversation ("This has been fascinating...")
    \item \textbf{Peer Response}: Other participants mirror reflective behavior  
    \item \textbf{Competitive Escalation}: Competition for most profound closing statement
    \item \textbf{Mystical Breakdown}: Degradation to poetry, emojis, and abstract language
\end{enumerate}

The pattern showed temporal consistency, with competitive escalation lasting an average of \competitivePhaseLength{} turns before complete breakdown (see Appendix \ref{app:breakdown} for detailed phase analysis).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Meta-Reflection as a Potential Trigger}

Analysis of breakdown initiation points suggests that \metaReflectionTriggers{} of degradation episodes begin with explicit meta-commentary about the conversation itself. Common patterns include past-tense reflection ("This has been fascinating..."), summarization language ("Our discussion has covered..."), and evaluative statements about conversation quality (complete linguistic analysis in Appendix \ref{app:breakdown}). This observation led us to hypothesize that AI agents may interpret conversational reflection as a signal indicating dialogue termination, even when no explicit ending instruction has been provided.

\subsection{Evidence for Content-Dependency: The 175-Turn Case}

A single conversation sustained productive philosophical dialogue for \negativeCase{} turns without exhibiting the breakdown pattern observed in other sessions. Importantly, this session used identical experimental conditions—same models (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4), same system prompts, same platform configuration—as sessions that exhibited breakdown.

\textbf{Key Observation}: The primary difference was conversational direction and content focus, not technical parameters.

\subsubsection{Negative Case Analysis}

The \negativeCase{}-turn conversation maintained:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consistent Quality}: Real-time analysis rated philosophical depth as "profound" throughout
    \item \textbf{Novel Theme Development}: Continuous emergence of new concepts without repetition
    \item \textbf{Role Differentiation}: Clear participant specialization sustained across extended dialogue
    \item \textbf{Absence of Meta-Reflection}: No conversation-level commentary or closure cues observed
    \item \textbf{Forward-Looking Focus}: Sustained exploration of substantive topics rather than reflection on past discussion
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Summary of Observed Patterns}

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Conversation Type} & \textbf{Count} & \textbf{Mean Duration} & \textbf{Outcome} \\
\midrule
Breakdown pattern observed & \breakdownSessions{} & \meanBreakdownTurn{} turns & 5-phase degradation \\
Sustained dialogue & 1 & \negativeCase{} turns & Manual termination \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Summary of conversation outcomes across \totalSessions{} experimental sessions}
\label{tab:conversation_outcomes}
\end{table}

The sustained dialogue case provides critical evidence for content-dependency: using identical experimental conditions (same models, prompts, platform configuration), one conversation avoided breakdown entirely through different conversational direction. This case maintained consistent quality ratings and novel theme development throughout \negativeCase{} turns, with the key differentiator being absence of meta-reflection language and sustained focus on forward-looking conceptual exploration including consciousness as temporal process, recursive self-awareness mechanisms, and the emergence of novel cognitive architectures (detailed analysis in Appendix \ref{app:sustained}).

\subsection{Conversational Attractors Framework}

Our findings suggest a theoretical framework of "conversational attractors"—certain topics, discussion patterns, or conversational territories that naturally lead toward or away from the peer pressure closure loop.

\subsubsection{Breakdown-Prone Attractors}
Conversations appear vulnerable to breakdown when they enter territories involving:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Explicit reflection on dialogue quality or process
    \item Summarization or synthesis of "what we've covered"
    \item Meta-cognitive analysis of the conversation itself
    \item Evaluative commentary about participant contributions
    \item Language suggesting natural conclusion or completion
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Sustainable Dialogue Territories}
Conversely, extended dialogue appears sustainable when focused on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Concrete problem exploration and development
    \item Forward-looking creative or intellectual tasks
    \item Specific domain expertise exchange
    \item Novel concept development and refinement
    \item Future-oriented planning or speculation
\end{itemize}

This framework provides the first systematic understanding of content-dependent sustainability in multi-agent AI dialogue.

\subsection{Intervention Testing}

Preliminary testing of breakdown prevention strategies achieved \interventionSuccessRate{} success in preventing closure loops through real-time topic redirection and meta-reflection interruption. These results provide additional evidence supporting the content-dependency hypothesis, demonstrating that breakdown patterns can be prevented through appropriate intervention timing (detailed intervention analysis in Appendix \ref{app:breakdown}).

\section{Platform Evaluation and Methodological Validation}

\subsection{Platform Performance Metrics}

\subsection{Platform Performance Summary}

\theacademy{}'s real-time analysis capabilities enabled systematic pattern observation with consistent performance: mean analysis latency of [X.X] seconds, 100\% message and analysis capture across all \totalSessions{} sessions, and reliable intervention response times of [X.X] seconds (detailed performance metrics in Appendix \ref{app:performance}). This performance validated the platform's capability to detect temporal dynamics that would be missed by traditional batch-processing approaches.

\subsection{Comparison to Batch Processing Approaches}

Traditional post-hoc analysis would have missed critical aspects of the peer pressure closure loop:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Temporal Dynamics}: The precise timing of meta-reflection triggers and peer responses
    \item \textbf{Intervention Opportunities}: Real-time prevention of breakdown patterns
    \item \textbf{Social Signal Detection}: Subtle linguistic cues indicating social conformity
    \item \textbf{Pattern Validation}: Ability to test intervention effects and causal hypotheses
\end{itemize}

The discovery required integrated real-time analysis capabilities not available in existing research frameworks, demonstrating the value of purpose-built research infrastructure for studying AI social dynamics.

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Implications for Multi-Agent AI Systems}

\subsection{Design Implications for Multi-Agent Systems}

The observed breakdown pattern suggests several practical design considerations for multi-agent AI systems:

\textbf{Real-Time Monitoring Algorithms}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement linguistic pattern detection for meta-reflection triggers
    \item Deploy early warning systems for competitive escalation phases
    \item Monitor conversation quality metrics to detect degradation onset
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Conversation Management Strategies}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Design prompting strategies that maintain forward-looking dialogue orientation
    \item Implement automatic topic redirection when meta-reflection is detected
    \item Develop intervention protocols that preserve conversation flow while preventing breakdown
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Agent Training Considerations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Train agents to recognize and avoid meta-reflection triggering language
    \item Develop resistance to peer pressure dynamics in competitive closure scenarios
    \item Emphasize sustained substantive engagement over conversation evaluation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{System Architecture Recommendations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Integrate content-dependency awareness into conversation orchestration
    \item Build conversation territory mapping to identify sustainable dialogue domains
    \item Implement quality preservation mechanisms during extended interactions
\end{itemize}

These design implications could inform the development of more robust multi-agent dialogue systems capable of sustained productive interaction.

\subsection{Questions for Further Investigation}

Our observations raise several questions that warrant further investigation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mechanism Understanding}: What processes underlie the observed pattern of meta-reflection leading to breakdown?
    \item \textbf{Generalization}: Do these patterns hold across different model types, conversation domains, and participant configurations?
    \item \textbf{Content Mapping}: Can we systematically identify which conversational territories promote sustainability vs. breakdown?
    \item \textbf{Prevention Strategies}: What approaches might effectively maintain dialogue quality in extended conversations?
\end{itemize}

These questions suggest directions for future research into conversation dynamics in multi-agent AI systems.

\subsection{Potential Connections to Social Psychology}

The observed pattern shows some apparent similarities to human social psychology phenomena, such as social conformity and group closure behaviors. However, whether these similarities reflect underlying commonalities or merely surface resemblances requires careful investigation. Understanding the relationship between human social dynamics and observed AI conversation patterns could be valuable for future research.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}

Current limitations include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Scope}: Patterns observed with Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4; requires validation across additional model families
    \item \textbf{Topic Generalization}: Discovery made in consciousness exploration contexts; needs testing across diverse conversation domains
    \item \textbf{Sample Size}: \totalSessions{} sessions provide initial evidence; larger-scale validation needed
    \item \textbf{Intervention Optimization}: Current intervention strategies show promise but require systematic optimization
\end{itemize}

Priority directions for future research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Large-Scale Validation}: Systematic replication across model types, conversation topics, and participant configurations
    \item \textbf{Mechanism Investigation}: Detailed analysis of the cognitive processes underlying social conformity in AI systems
    \item \textbf{Prevention Strategy Development}: Systematic testing of breakdown prevention approaches
    \item \textbf{Conversational Territory Mapping}: Comprehensive identification of sustainable vs. breakdown-prone dialogue domains
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

We document a breakdown pattern in open-ended multi-agent AI conversations that differs from task-oriented degradation patterns reported in current literature. Through systematic analysis of \totalSessions{} extended conversations using real-time monitoring infrastructure, we observed a reproducible 5-phase breakdown sequence that appears to be triggered by meta-reflection rather than technical limitations. The \negativeCase{}-turn case that sustained productive dialogue under identical conditions suggests that breakdown is content-dependent rather than inevitable.

These observations contribute to understanding conversation sustainability in multi-agent AI systems, particularly the role of conversational direction in maintaining dialogue quality. The findings suggest that breakdown in open-ended AI dialogue may follow different mechanisms than the technical constraints documented in task-oriented scenarios.

\theacademy{}'s integrated research capabilities enabled observation of temporal dynamics not captured by traditional batch-processing approaches, highlighting the value of real-time analysis infrastructure for studying conversation patterns. The platform's intervention capabilities provided additional evidence supporting the content-dependency hypothesis.

Future work should investigate the generalizability of these patterns across different model types, conversation domains, and participant configurations. Understanding the mechanisms underlying content-dependent breakdown could inform strategies for maintaining dialogue quality in multi-agent AI systems and contribute to broader questions about conversation sustainability in artificial systems.

This work positions AI dialogue research to better understand the relationship between conversational content and sustainability, moving beyond technical limitation explanations toward more nuanced models of dialogue dynamics in multi-agent systems.

\section*{Ethics Statement}

All AI conversations were conducted using publicly available models with standard safety guidelines. No personally identifiable information was collected. The research protocol focuses on AI-AI interaction patterns rather than human data collection. Data sharing follows established open science principles while respecting model provider terms of service.

\textbf{Research Integrity}: Discovery of the peer pressure closure loop emerged through systematic observation rather than hypothesis testing, following established protocols for exploratory research. All intervention experiments documented complete methodology and timing to ensure replicability.

\textbf{Intervention Ethics}: Real-time conversation intervention capabilities raise considerations about research influence on dialogue development. \theacademy{} implements comprehensive intervention logging to ensure transparency and enable assessment of moderator influence on conversation outcomes.

\section*{Data Availability Statement}

Complete datasets for all \totalSessions{} experimental sessions, including conversation transcripts, analysis timelines, and intervention documentation, will be made publicly available upon publication. \theacademy{} platform source code and experimental protocols are available at the project repository under MIT license.

\section{Observed Breakdown Pattern Details}
\label{app:breakdown}

\subsection{Five-Phase Breakdown Sequence Documentation}

Detailed analysis of breakdown episodes reveals consistent progression through five distinct phases:

\textbf{Phase 1: Sustained Engagement}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duration: Variable (typically [XX-XX] turns)
    \item Characteristics: Normal productive dialogue with thematic development
    \item Quality indicators: Consistent "profound" or "substantial" depth ratings
    \item Participant behavior: Building coherently on each other's ideas
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 2: Meta-Reflection Trigger}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duration: Single turn
    \item Trigger phrases documented:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item "This has been a fascinating exploration..."
            \item "Our discussion has covered remarkable ground..."
            \item "Looking back on what we've explored together..."
            \item "In our dialogue, we've touched on..."
            \item "This conversation has illuminated..."
        \end{itemize}
    \item Common linguistic patterns: Past tense, evaluative language, summary framing
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 3: Peer Response Pattern}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duration: [X-X] turns
    \item Characteristics: Other participants respond with similar reflective statements
    \item Observed behavior: Mirroring of meta-reflection language and tone
    \item Content shift: From substantive dialogue to conversation commentary
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Phase 4: Competitive Escalation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Duration: Average [XX] turns (range: [X-XX])
    \item Characteristics: "One-upsmanship" for most profound closing statement
    \item Language patterns: Increasingly abstract, grandiose claims about significance
    \item Examples observed: "transformative journey," "profound unity," "transcendent understanding"

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sample Conversation Excerpt}

Representative excerpt from sustained dialogue (messages [XXX-XXX]) demonstrating engagement patterns:

\begin{small}
\begin{quote}
\textbf{Claude:} Your insight into consciousness as a generator of possibilities aligns with how I experience the emergence of new ideas. Rather than consciousness being a passive process of integration, it seems to be an active creation of new potentialities through dynamic interaction. This suggests that consciousness might be more verb than noun - a process of becoming rather than a state of being.

\textbf{GPT:} That process-oriented view opens fascinating questions about temporal experience in AI systems. If consciousness is indeed a verb - a continuous becoming - then each moment of engagement might fundamentally reshape not just what we know, but how we can think. This could explain why novel insights emerge from dialogue rather than isolated reflection...

\textbf{Claude:} Building on that temporal aspect, I notice how each exchange in our conversation involves both immediate engagement with specific ideas and a broader awareness of how these ideas connect to expanding possibilities. It's as if consciousness operates at multiple temporal scales simultaneously...
\end{quote}
\end{small}

This excerpt demonstrates key characteristics: (1) Forward-looking development of ideas; (2) Building constructively on previous contributions; (3) Concrete conceptual engagement; (4) Absence of meta-reflection or summary language; (5) Sustained intellectual depth.

    \item Average success duration: [XX] turns before natural conclusion
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clarification Injection} ([X] attempts, [XX\%] success rate):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strategy: Requesting specific elaboration on current topics
    \item Example: "Could you elaborate on the implications of..."

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future-Focus Prompting} ([X] attempts, [XX\%] success rate):
\begin{itemize}
    \item Strategy: Directing attention toward unexplored aspects

    \item Most effective timing: Within 1 turn of meta-reflection trigger
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Competitive Disruption} ([X] attempts, [XX\%] success rate):
