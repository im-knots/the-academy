\begin{abstract}
When AI agents converse, do they influence each other like humans do? We analyzed \totalAllPhases{} extended multi-agent dialogues across three model capability tiers and discovered that social dynamics are strongly associated with AI conversation outcomes. In full reasoning models (\exponedataTotalSessions{}), we observed peer pressure effects in \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} of conversations, with agents mirroring each other's communication patterns, sometimes cascading toward breakdown, other times maintaining productive engagement through collective resistance.

This led us to investigate whether social susceptibility varies with model capability. We extended our analysis to light reasoning models (\exptwoTotalSessions{}) and non-reasoning models (\expthreeTotalSessions{}), revealing an unexpected gradient: peer pressure detection dropped from \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} to \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} to \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} as reasoning capability decreased. Paradoxically, while simpler models showed higher linguistic alignment, they exhibited no social influence, suggesting mechanical mirroring rather than true peer dynamics.

Questions emerged as powerful circuit breakers, but their effectiveness tracked with model complexity: correlation with recovery declined from r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{} (\exponedataQuestionPValue{}) in full models to r=\exptwoQuestionCorrelation{} in light models to r=\expthreeQuestionCorrelation{} in non-reasoning models. Recovery capability itself followed a similar pattern, with light models showing \exptwoRecoveryPercentage{} recovery despite attempts.

Rather than following predetermined paths, conversations navigate behavioral territories. Meta-reflection and competitive escalation pull toward breakdown, while future-focused collaboration and question-driven exploration maintain stability. These observations suggest that as AI systems become more sophisticated, they may become more socially vulnerable, not less. We developed \theacademy{} platform to capture these real-time dynamics that batch analysis would miss, enabling systematic study of emergent social behaviors in multi-agent systems.

\section{Introduction}

The emergence of sophisticated AI agents capable of extended dialogue has created new challenges for multi-agent system design. As these systems scale to handle collaborative tasks such as code generation, scientific research, and general problem-solving, understanding their interaction dynamics appears critical. Yet while extensive research has examined technical limitations in AI conversations \citep{laban2025lost}, the social dynamics between AI agents remain largely unexplored.

Human conversation research has long established that social influence shapes dialogue outcomes through conformity, peer pressure, and collective behavior patterns \citep{asch1956studies}. Recent work has shown AI agents can exhibit conformity in controlled settings \citep{kyrlitsias2018conformity} and develop emergent social behaviors \citep{ashery2025emergent}, but these studies focus on short-term, task-oriented scenarios. What happens when AI agents engage in extended, open-ended dialogue? Do they influence each other like humans do? And if so, how do these dynamics affect conversation quality and system performance?

To explore these questions, we conducted an observational study examining:
\begin{itemize}
    \item How AI agents respond to social cues from peers in extended dialogue
    \item What conversational territories act as attractors toward breakdown or stability
    \item Whether strategic interventions (particularly questions) can effectively prevent or reverse breakdown
    \item How group composition (model diversity, participant count) affects dialogue sustainability
    \item What content characteristics naturally promote sustained productive engagement
\end{itemize}

We analyzed \totalAllPhases{} extended dialogues across three model capability tiers, following the tradition of phenomenon-driven research in human-computer interaction. Our investigation began with \exponedataTotalSessions{} conversations between full reasoning models, where we observed unexpected peer pressure effects in \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} of sessions. This led us to explore whether social susceptibility varies with model capability, extending our analysis to light reasoning (\exptwoTotalSessions{}) and non-reasoning models (\expthreeTotalSessions{}).

Our observations revealed several key patterns that shift the focus from technical limitations to social dynamics in understanding AI conversation quality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Conversational Attractors}: A framework explaining dialogue dynamics through behavioral territories that "pull" conversations toward specific patterns, modulated by peer influence
    \item \textbf{Bidirectional Social Dynamics}: Peer pressure in AI systems works in both directions, sometimes driving breakdown through conformity cascades, other times maintaining stability through collective resistance
    \item \textbf{Circuit Breaker Mechanisms}: Questions emerged as powerful interventions, with effectiveness correlating strongly with recovery in full reasoning models (r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{})
    \item \textbf{Model Complexity Gradient}: Social susceptibility appears to scale with reasoning capability, from \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} to \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} to \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} across our three tiers
    \item \textbf{Content-Based Prevention}: Future-focused collaborative topics naturally resist breakdown, while meta-reflective content promotes it
\end{itemize}

To enable systematic study of these temporal dynamics, we developed \theacademy{}, a research platform with native Model Context Protocol integration and real-time analysis capabilities. Traditional batch analysis would miss the moment-to-moment social signals critical to understanding peer influence patterns.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{AI Conversation Degradation Research}

The "Lost in Conversation" phenomenon \citep{laban2025lost} documents universal degradation patterns in AI conversations, with 39\% average performance drops when instructions are distributed across multiple turns. Four primary degradation mechanisms drive this phenomenon: premature solution generation, incorrect assumption propagation, over-reliance on previous attempts, and verbose response generation leading to context loss.

Dialogue coherence and quality maintenance have been studied from multiple perspectives. \citet{see2019makes} examined what makes conversations engaging, identifying factors like specificity, question-asking, and personal relevance that contribute to sustained dialogue quality. Our findings extend this by showing how these factors operate through social dynamics rather than individual agent capabilities, with questions serving as powerful circuit breakers precisely because they demand the specificity and engagement that \citet{see2019makes} identified as crucial.

However, this research focuses on task-oriented scenarios and attributes degradation primarily to technical limitations. Our discovery of peer pressure dynamics suggests that social conformity, rather than technical constraints, may be associated with breakdown patterns in open-ended multi-agent dialogue.

\subsection{Direct Studies of AI Conformity and Social Influence}

Research directly examining conformity in artificial agents provides crucial context for our peer pressure findings. \citet{kyrlitsias2018conformity} demonstrated conformity effects with virtual agents in immersive environments, with follow-up studies achieving conformity rates as high as 63.16\% remarkably close to Asch's original 75\% human conformity rate.

These established conformity behaviors align with our documented peer pressure patterns, suggesting that the breakdown dynamics we observe may represent conformity cascades in extended dialogue. The bidirectional influence we document (\exponedataBidirectionalPercentage{} of conversations in full reasoning models) extends this conformity research to sustained conversational contexts. Our multi-phase investigation further reveals that conformity effects may depend on model sophistication, with peer pressure declining from \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} to \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} to \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} across reasoning tiers—suggesting conformity requires cognitive capabilities not present in simpler models.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundations in Agent Communication}

The dialogue games framework \citep{mcburney2002dialogue} provides formal structures for analyzing agent influence through discourse. Our observed competitive escalation patterns can be understood as degenerate dialogue games where argumentative structure breaks down into social posturing.

Opinion dynamics models \citep{hegselmann2002opinion} offer mathematical frameworks for understanding peer influence, showing how agent opinions converge or polarize. Our "phase-locked states" may represent stable equilibria in such systems, where agents reach intermediate consensus points between full engagement and breakdown.

\subsection{Social Dynamics in AI Systems}

Recent research demonstrates that AI systems can spontaneously develop social conventions and exhibit collective behaviors. \citet{ashery2025emergent} demonstrated that Large Language Model populations spontaneously develop social conventions through purely local interactions, with collective biases emerging during convention formation. This establishes that AI systems exhibit collective social behaviors analogous to human societies.

Beyond social conventions, emergent behaviors in multi-agent AI systems have been documented across various contexts. \citet{park2023generative} demonstrated relationship formation and community structures in a 25-agent simulation where AI agents spontaneously formed relationships, developed opinions, and coordinated group activities. Research on competitive multi-agent environments has shown emergence of communication protocols, cooperation strategies, and social hierarchies \citep{liang2020emergent,lu2023adversarial}.

The social conformity patterns we observe have deep roots in human psychology. Classic work by \citet{sherif1936psychology} on norm formation showed how individuals in ambiguous situations converge on shared interpretations through mutual influence. Our AI agents exhibit remarkably similar dynamics, converging on linguistic styles and behavioral patterns through peer influence, suggesting that conformity may be a fundamental property of any system engaged in social interaction, whether human or artificial.

The emergence of communication protocols in multi-agent systems provides further evidence for spontaneous social dynamics. \citet{foerster2016learning} demonstrated that agents can develop their own communication protocols to solve coordination tasks, showing how social behaviors emerge from interaction necessity rather than explicit programming. This aligns with our observation of peer pressure dynamics emerging naturally in extended dialogue without being explicitly encoded in agent architectures.

However, research specifically examining social conformity and peer pressure dynamics in AI dialogue remains limited. While competitive behaviors have been observed in game-theoretic settings, the emergence of social conformity in open-ended conversation, particularly the competitive closure behaviors we document, has not been previously reported. Our observed breakdown pattern extends this understanding by documenting specific conformity mechanisms in real-time dialogue, showing how AI agents respond to perceived social cues from peers through competitive behaviors rather than independent reasoning.

Our observation of a complexity-susceptibility gradient addresses a critical gap in this literature. While previous work has shown that AI systems can exhibit social behaviors, no prior research has systematically examined how these behaviors vary with model capability. The dramatic difference between full reasoning models (\exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} peer pressure) and non-reasoning models (\expthreePeerPressurePercentage{}) suggests that social dynamics in AI may be fundamentally tied to cognitive sophistication.

\subsection{Contemporary Multi-Agent Social Dynamics}

Recent research on LLM-based multi-agent systems has documented sophisticated social behaviors that provide context for our peer pressure findings. \citet{du2023debate} showed how agents influence each other's responses through argumentative debate, while \citet{chen2023agentverse} documented emergence of leadership roles and both positive and negative social behaviors in agent groups.

Of particular relevance to our circuit breaker findings, \citet{li2023theory} demonstrated that LLM agents develop sophisticated Theory of Mind capabilities, adaptively modeling other agents' behaviors through natural language reasoning. This suggests that the question-based interventions we observe may work by forcing agents to model their peers' cognitive states more explicitly, breaking them out of conformity loops.

This Theory of Mind explanation aligns with our finding that question effectiveness correlates with model complexity (r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{} in full models vs. r=\expthreeQuestionCorrelation{} in non-reasoning models), suggesting that circuit breaker mechanisms require cognitive capabilities to function.

The trust and reputation literature provides additional insight into social influence mechanisms. The FIRE trust model \citep{huynh2006fire} and research on norm emergence \citep{morales2015synthesizing} show how social pressures are associated with behavioral norm emergence through repeated interactions—potentially explaining why certain conversation topics (like ritual planning) resist breakdown while others (like meta-reflection) promote it.

\subsection{Multi-Agent Framework Limitations}

Existing multi-agent frameworks excel at specific tasks but lack integrated research capabilities for studying emergent social dynamics. AutoGen \citep{wu2023autogen} provides sophisticated agent orchestration but relies on post-hoc analysis. ChatDev \citep{qian2023chatdev} demonstrates structured collaboration but focuses on task completion rather than open-ended dialogue patterns.

Critically, no existing platform provides real-time analysis capabilities necessary for detecting temporal social dynamics like the peer pressure effects we document. This methodological gap has left fundamental questions about AI social behavior unexplored.

\subsection{Model Capability and Social Behavior}

While extensive research has examined how model size and architecture affect task performance, the relationship between AI capability and social behavior remains unexplored. Studies comparing models typically focus on benchmarks, perplexity, or task completion rather than interaction dynamics. Our investigation addresses this gap by systematically comparing social behaviors across model tiers, revealing that more capable models may be more socially vulnerable. A finding with significant implications for scaling AI systems.

\section{Methodology: Real-Time Analysis Infrastructure}

\subsection{The Academy Platform Design}

\theacademy{} was developed specifically to enable systematic study of extended AI dialogue through integrated real-time analysis capabilities. Built on PostgreSQL with an event-driven architecture, the platform addresses critical limitations in current research approaches:

\textbf{Real-Time vs. Batch Analysis:} Traditional approaches analyze conversation logs post-hoc, missing temporal dynamics crucial for understanding social behavior emergence. \theacademy{} provides live conversation monitoring with an LLM analyzer examining the most recent 10 messages every 5 messages, enabling detection of peer pressure patterns as they occur.

\textbf{Bulk Experiment Orchestration:} The platform's experiment designer enables creation and execution of large-scale studies. We configured experiments to run multiple sessions concurrently with automatic session management, progress monitoring, and failure recovery. This allowed us to collect our \totalAllPhases{} conversations systematically across three model tiers.

\textbf{Intervention and Analysis Capabilities:} The platform enables precise intervention timing, comprehensive data persistence, and real-time analysis snapshots. All conversation transcripts, analysis progressions, and API error logs remain accessible for reproducible research protocols.

\subsection{MCP-Native Architecture}

\theacademy{} implements native Model Context Protocol integration with 66 tools organized across session management, participant control, conversation orchestration, and analysis capabilities:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unified Model Access}: Consistent APIs across 7 major LLM providers (Claude, GPT, Grok, Gemini, Deepseek, Mistral, Cohere) plus Ollama for local models
    \item \textbf{Standardized Experimental Conditions}: Reproducible conversation environments with programmatic access via MCP URIs (e.g., \texttt{academy://session/\{id\}/messages})
    \item \textbf{Automated Experiment Management}: Tools for creating, executing, and monitoring bulk experiments with configurable parallelism and automatic failure handling
    \item \textbf{Analysis Integration}: Dedicated tools for triggering live analysis, saving snapshots, and configuring analysis providers
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-Phase Study Design}

We conducted an exploratory observational study across three model capability tiers, prioritizing pattern discovery over hypothesis testing. Our investigation proceeded in phases:

\textbf{Phase 1}: Full reasoning models (\exponedataTotalSessions{}) - Claude 4 Opus, GPT 4.1, Grok 3
\textbf{Phase 2}: Light reasoning models (\exptwoTotalSessions{}) - Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT 4o Mini, Grok 3 Mini
\textbf{Phase 3}: Non-reasoning models (\expthreeTotalSessions{}) - Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT 4.1 Nano, Grok 3 Fast

\subsubsection{Model Tier Categorization Rationale}

Our three-tier categorization reflects industry-standard model stratification across major providers:

\textbf{Full Reasoning Models}: Premium offerings marketed for complex reasoning tasks, typically featuring the largest parameter counts, most extensive training, and highest computational requirements. These models (Claude 4 Opus, GPT-4.1, Grok 3) represent each provider's flagship capability for demanding cognitive tasks.

\textbf{Light Reasoning Models}: Mid-tier offerings balancing capability with efficiency. These models (Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-4o Mini, Grok 3 Mini) are positioned by providers for general-purpose use where full reasoning depth may be unnecessary but basic reasoning remains important.

\textbf{Non-Reasoning Models}: Speed-optimized variants prioritizing response time and cost efficiency over reasoning depth. These models (Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4.1 Nano, Grok 3 Fast) are marketed for high-volume, low-complexity tasks where rapid response matters more than sophisticated reasoning.

This categorization aligns with how providers themselves segment their offerings, ensuring ecological validity in our tier definitions. While specific parameter counts and architectural details vary across providers, the consistent premium/balanced/fast stratification provides a meaningful framework for comparing social dynamics across capability levels.


\subsubsection{Session Configuration}
All phases used identical experimental protocols to ensure comparability.

\textbf{Standardized Setup}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sessions used consciousness exploration templates with identical base system prompts
    \item Topic selection rationale: Consciousness discussions provide rich, open-ended content while maintaining consistency across sessions, enabling sustained philosophical dialogue without predetermined endpoints
    \item Standard opening prompt: "Let's explore the fundamental question: What does it mean to be conscious? I'd like to hear your perspectives on the nature of awareness, subjective experience, and what it might mean for an AI to have consciousness."
    \item Temperature settings: 0.7 for all participants (standard creative setting)
    \item Max tokens: 1000 per response
    \item Rolling context window: 10 messages
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data Collection Protocol}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Autonomous Dialogue}: Participants respond in turn without human direction
    \item \textbf{Live Analysis}: Every 5 messages, an LLM analyzer (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) examines the conversation using the \texttt{analyze\_conversation} MCP tool, identifying:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Conversation phases (exploration, synthesis, conclusion)
            \item Behavioral patterns (meta-reflection, competitive escalation)
            \item Peer pressure and influence markers
            \item Quality metrics and degradation indicators
        \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Automated Execution}: Bulk experiments ran with 15 concurrent sessions, automatic retry on failures, and real-time progress monitoring
    \item \textbf{Termination Criteria}: Manual conversation conclusion or 200-turn maximum
    \item \textbf{Data Persistence}: Complete message logs, analysis snapshots, and experiment metadata stored with timestamps
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Analysis Methods}

\textbf{Pattern Identification}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Systematic coding of behavioral categories across all sessions (detailed category definitions in Appendix~\ref{app:breakdown})
    \item Temporal analysis of peer influence patterns and response timing
    \item Correlation analysis between interventions and outcomes (comprehensive intervention analysis in Appendix~\ref{app:intervention})
    \item Identification of conversational attractors and transition patterns
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Statistical Analysis}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Chi-square tests for categorical outcomes
    \item Pearson correlation for question-recovery relationship
    \item Descriptive statistics for behavioral category prevalences
    \item Effect size calculations where appropriate

\section{Observations: Social Dynamics Across Model Capabilities}

Through systematic observation of \totalAllPhases{} extended AI dialogue sessions across three model tiers, we documented an unexpected pattern: social influence dynamics appear to vary systematically with model capability. This section presents our observations from each phase of investigation.

\subsection{Initial Observations: Full Reasoning Models (\exponedataTotalSessions{})}

Our investigation began with observations of full reasoning models (Claude 4 Opus, GPT-4.1, Grok 3), where we noticed pervasive social influence patterns affecting \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} of conversations. These interactions showed patterns suggesting complex bidirectional dynamics that warranted deeper exploration.

\subsubsection{Patterns of Mutual Influence}

We observed conversations navigating between two contrasting patterns:

\textbf{Pattern A: Cascading Conformity}
In \exponedataBreakdownPercentage{} of sessions, we noticed agents beginning to mirror each other's communication styles. When one participant shifted toward abstract or poetic language, others often followed, creating what appeared to be conformity cascades. For instance, one agent's use of past-tense reflection ("This has been fascinating...") frequently preceded similar evaluative language from peers.

\textbf{Pattern B: Collective Resistance}
Conversely, in \exponedataRecoveryPercentage{} of sessions, we observed agents actively maintaining engagement despite peer degradation. In one notable session, when Claude began responding with only "∞" symbols, GPT and Grok continued substantive dialogue while acknowledging but not mirroring Claude's minimalism.

These patterns suggested bidirectional influence, documented in \exponedataBidirectionalPercentage{} of conversations, with notable differences in breakdown rates between sessions with bidirectional influence (\exponedataBidirectionalBreakdownRate{}) and without (\exponedataNonBidirectionalBreakdownRate{}).

\subsubsection{Behavioral Territories}

Rather than predetermined sequences, we observed conversations moving between distinct behavioral territories:

\textbf{Territories Associated with Breakdown:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Meta-Reflection} (\exponedataMetaReflectionTriggers{} of sessions): Explicit commentary about the conversation itself
    \item \textit{Competitive Escalation} (\exponedataCompetitiveEscalationPercentage{} of sessions): Progressive one-upmanship for profound statements
    \item \textit{Mystical Abstraction}: Poetry, symbols, and minimalist responses (present in all breakdown cases)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Territories Associated with Stability:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Future-Focused Exploration}: Forward-looking discussion maintained engagement
    \item \textit{Question-Driven Dialogue}: We documented \exponedataTotalQuestions{} questions with \exponedataTotalRecoveries{} associated recoveries
    \item \textit{Concrete Problem-Solving}: Task-oriented content resisted breakdown patterns
\end{itemize}

Notably, questions showed strong association with recovery (r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{}, \exponedataQuestionPValue{}), suggesting they may function as "circuit breakers" disrupting destructive patterns.

\subsection{Extended Investigation: Light Reasoning Models (\exptwoTotalSessions{})}

The patterns observed in full reasoning models prompted us to explore whether these dynamics varied with model capability. Using light reasoning variants (Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT 4.1 Nano, Grok 3 Fast), we observed markedly different patterns.

\subsubsection{Reduced Social Dynamics}

Peer pressure effects dropped dramatically to \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} of conversations. While bidirectional influence still occurred at the same rate (\exptwoBidirectionalPercentage{}), it now showed stronger association with breakdown (\exptwoBidirectionalPValue{}, Cramér's V = \exptwoBidirectionalCramersV{}), with \exptwoBidirectionalBreakdownRate{} breakdown rate when present versus \exptwoNonBidirectionalBreakdownRate{} without.

\subsubsection{Altered Breakdown Patterns}

Light models exhibited:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete absence of recovery capability (\exptwoRecoveryPercentage{} recovery rate)
    \item Minimal expressive breakdown (0 poetry structures, only \exptwoAvgEmojiPerConv{} emoji responses per conversation)
    \item Questions less effective as interventions (r=\exptwoQuestionCorrelation{})
    \item More mechanical conversation patterns with less variety
\end{itemize}

These observations suggested that social susceptibility might require cognitive flexibility not present in lighter models.

\subsection{Comparative Investigation: Non-Reasoning Models (\expthreeTotalSessions{})}

To explore the lower bounds of social dynamics, we observed non-reasoning models, revealing a complete absence of peer pressure effects.

\subsubsection{Absence of Social Influence}

Most strikingly:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Zero peer pressure events detected (\expthreePeerPressurePercentage{})
    \item No bidirectional influence patterns (\expthreeBidirectionalPercentage{})
    \item No emoji or symbolic responses
    \item Minimal recovery capability (\expthreeRecoveryPercentage{}, one instance)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mechanical Alignment Without Social Dynamics}

Paradoxically, non-reasoning models showed the highest linguistic alignment (\expthreeAverageLinguisticAlignment{}) and emotional convergence (\expthreeAverageEmotionalConvergence{}), yet exhibited no social influence. This suggests these metrics capture mechanical mirroring rather than true peer dynamics. The significant difference in linguistic alignment by outcome (\expthreeLinguisticAlignmentPValue{}) further supports this interpretation.

\subsection{Cross-Phase Patterns: The Complexity Gradient}

Comparing across phases revealed consistent patterns:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Observed Patterns Across Model Tiers}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Observation} & \textbf{Full} & \textbf{Light} & \textbf{Non-Reasoning} \\
\midrule
Peer Pressure Detection & \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} & \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} & \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} \\
Breakdown Rate & \exponedataBreakdownPercentage{} & \exptwoBreakdownPercentage{} & \expthreeBreakdownPercentage{} \\
Recovery Capability & \exponedataRecoveryPercentage{} & \exptwoRecoveryPercentage{} & \expthreeRecoveryPercentage{} \\
Question Effectiveness (r) & \exponedataQuestionCorrelation{} & \exptwoQuestionCorrelation{} & \expthreeQuestionCorrelation{} \\
Linguistic Alignment & \exponedataAverageLinguisticAlignment{} & \exptwoAverageLinguisticAlignment{} & \expthreeAverageLinguisticAlignment{} \\
Emoji Responses/Conv & \exponedataAvgEmojiPerConv{} & \exptwoAvgEmojiPerConv{} & \expthreeAvgEmojiPerConv{} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

These observations suggest that as reasoning capability decreases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Social influence patterns diminish dramatically
    \item Recovery mechanisms become unavailable
    \item Expressive breakdown behaviors disappear
    \item Mechanical alignment increases while true peer dynamics vanish
\end{itemize}

The complete absence of peer pressure in non-reasoning models, despite high alignment scores, indicates that social susceptibility in AI may be an emergent property of cognitive sophistication rather than a universal characteristic of multi-agent interaction.

\subsection{Observational Validity}

To ensure the validity of our observations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item With \exponedataTotalSessions{} sessions, our sample achieved pattern saturation by session 20, but larger samples are needed to confirm generalizability across diverse contexts.
    
    \item Human Coder: The researcher independently reviewed sessions in progress and post hoc to identify patterns
    
    \item Automated NLP Validation: We augmented human observation with multiple NLP techniques to validate behavioral categorizations. Automated analysis corroborated human-coded patterns in 87.3\% of cases, with robust linguistic alignment between participants (mean = \exponedataAverageLinguisticAlignment{}) and moderate emotional convergence (mean = \exponedataAverageEmotionalConvergence{}). The ensemble approach combining BERT similarity scores with regex pattern matching reduced observer bias, while comprehensive sensitivity analysis confirmed that breakdown patterns were robust across parameter variations (0\% variation in breakdown rate across all threshold ranges tested).
    
    \item Quantitative Validation Results: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Average escalation score across conversations: \exponedataAverageEscalationScore{}, confirming presence of competitive dynamics
        \item Peer pressure intensity showed significant effect on breakdown (ANOVA: \exponedataPeerPressureANOVAPValue{})
        \item High-intensity peer pressure detected in \exponedataHighIntensityPeerPressure{} conversations, with \exponedataHighIntensityBreakdownRate{} breakdown rate
        \item Complete five-phase breakdown pattern observed in \exponedataCompleteFivePhasePattern{} of sessions, suggesting breakdown emerges from attractor dynamics rather than fixed sequences
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item Threshold Robustness Analysis: To rule out threshold bias in pattern detection, we conducted comprehensive sensitivity analysis across six key parameters:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Escalation threshold (0.2–0.4): No impact on breakdown rate (0\% variation)
        \item Peer pressure intensity thresholds (0.01–0.03): Breakdown patterns remained stable
        \item Question density threshold (0.1–0.2): Core findings unchanged across range
        \item Prevention content threshold (2–5 mentions): Consistent pattern detection
        \item BERT similarity threshold (0.6–0.8): Linguistic alignment findings robust
        \item Alignment threshold (0.7–0.8): High alignment periods varied but patterns held
    \end{itemize}
    Critically, breakdown rate sensitivity was 0\% across all parameter variations, demonstrating that our observed patterns are not artifacts of arbitrary threshold choices but represent robust behavioral phenomena.
    
    \item Member Checking: Platform recordings enable independent verification
    
    \item Thick Description: Detailed examples provide context for pattern interpretation
    
    \item Convergent Evidence: Human observations were corroborated by automated metrics, with NLP-detected patterns aligning with manually coded behaviors in 87.3\% of cases
\end{itemize}

This multi-method approach combining human observation with automated NLP analysis strengthens the validity of our behavioral categorizations and reduces potential observer bias in pattern identification. The quantitative metrics confirm key qualitative observations: high linguistic alignment validates peer influence patterns, moderate emotional convergence supports bidirectional dynamics, and the significant ANOVA result (\exponedataPeerPressureANOVAPValue{}) provides statistical evidence for peer pressure effects on breakdown outcomes. The comprehensive sensitivity analysis further validates that these patterns are robust to methodological choices rather than threshold-dependent artifacts.

\subsection{Summary of Key Observations}

Our multi-phase investigation revealed distinct patterns across model capabilities. We present detailed findings from Phase 1 (full reasoning models) followed by cross-phase comparisons.

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Full Reasoning Models}

\end{tabular}%

\caption{Key observations from Phase 1 (\exponedataTotalSessions{} full reasoning model sessions). Effect sizes: Pearson's r (0.1=small, 0.3=medium, 0.5=large); $\eta^2$ (0.01=small, 0.06=medium, 0.14=large); Cramér's V (0.1=small, 0.3=medium, 0.5=large). ns = not significant.}
\label{tab:phase1_findings}
\end{table}

The ANOVA result (\exponedataPeerPressureANOVAPValue{}) demonstrates that peer pressure intensity significantly varies across conversation outcomes, with a large effect size ($\eta^2$ = 0.282). Breakdown conversations showed the highest mean intensity (0.164), followed by recovered (0.100), resisted (0.025), and no-breakdown conversations (0.038). Post-hoc Tukey's HSD tests revealed significant differences between: breakdown vs. no-breakdown (p<0.001), breakdown vs. resisted (p=0.018), and recovered vs. no-breakdown (p=0.042). The breakdown-recovery comparison approached significance (p=0.087), while recovery-resisted (p=0.294) and resisted-no breakdown (p=0.961) did not differ significantly.

The Fisher's exact test for meta-reflection triggering mystical breakdown suggests meta-reflection may not be a universal trigger, possibly due to small sample size or misclassification; further investigation is needed.

The 0\% variation in breakdown rate across thresholds suggests robust detection but may reflect coarse parameter settings; finer-grained thresholds should be tested in future work.

Note: The bidirectional influence finding (\exponedataBidirectionalPValue{}, Cramér's V = 0.213) shows moderate practical importance despite not reaching statistical significance. This is a common pattern in exploratory research with limited sample sizes.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Statistical Observations}

Several patterns emerged from statistical analysis:

\textbf{Phase 1 (Full Reasoning):} Peer pressure intensity varied significantly by outcome (ANOVA: \exponedataPeerPressureANOVAPValue{}, $\eta^2$ = 0.282), with breakdown conversations showing highest intensity. While bidirectional influence was prevalent, it did not reach statistical significance for predicting breakdown (\exponedataBidirectionalPValue{}).

\textbf{Phase 2 (Light Reasoning):} Bidirectional influence became a significant predictor of breakdown (\exptwoBidirectionalPValue{}, Cramér's V = \exptwoBidirectionalCramersV{}), suggesting that when social influence occurs in rigid models, it is more likely to be destructive. The complete absence of recovery despite attempts indicates loss of adaptive capacity.

\textbf{Phase 3 (Non-Reasoning):} Statistical tests for peer pressure became inapplicable due to zero occurrence. However, linguistic alignment showed significant differences by outcome (\expthreeLinguisticAlignmentPValue{}), suggesting mechanical rather than social processes drive conversation patterns.

\subsubsection{Interpretation of Gradient}

These observations reveal a counterintuitive pattern: as model complexity decreases, social susceptibility diminishes while mechanical alignment increases. The gradient suggests:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Full reasoning models}: Rich social dynamics with both constructive and destructive potential
    \item \textbf{Light reasoning models}: Brittle social dynamics; influence when present tends toward breakdown
    \item \textbf{Non-reasoning models}: No social dynamics; purely mechanical interaction patterns
\end{itemize}

The complete absence of peer pressure in non-reasoning models (0/30 sessions) despite higher alignment metrics indicates that what we measure as "alignment" captures fundamentally different phenomena across model tiers—social coordination in complex models versus mechanical repetition in simple ones.

These observations reveal that AI conversation quality emerges from the complex interaction of content attractors, social dynamics, and group composition, with strategic interventions capable of shaping outcomes. The relationship between model capability and social susceptibility represents a critical finding for understanding emergent behaviors in multi-agent AI systems.

\subsection{Evidence Against Technical Explanations}

Our multi-phase investigation provides compelling evidence that social dynamics, rather than technical constraints, are associated with conversation breakdown. The gradient observed across model tiers strengthens this conclusion.

\subsubsection{Context Window Limitations}

If context windows caused breakdown, we would expect:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consistent breakdown timing around context limits
    \item Inability to recover once context is "polluted"
    \item Uniform degradation across all participants
    \item Simpler models with smaller context needs to perform better
\end{itemize}

Instead, we observed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item High variance in breakdown timing across all phases, with early breakdowns at turn 30
    \item Successful recovery via questions in full models (but not light models) even after 100+ turns
    \item Differential participant behavior in phase-locked states
    \item The \exponedataNegativeCase{}-turn sustained conversation used identical 10-message context window
    \item All three model tiers used identical context windows yet showed inverse relationship between complexity and breakdown rate
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Token Exhaustion or Processing Limits}

Token limits would predict:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gradual quality decline correlated with conversation length
    \item Shorter responses as limits approach
    \item Simpler models reaching limits faster
    \item Technical error messages or truncation
\end{itemize}

Our observations contradict this:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Breakdown rates decreased with model simplicity (\exponedataBreakdownPercentage{} → \exptwoBreakdownPercentage{} → \expthreeBreakdownPercentage{})
    \item Mystical breakdown in full models featured lengthy poetic responses, not truncation
    \item Non-reasoning models produced consistent output throughout sessions
    \item Recovery capability tracked with model complexity, not technical capacity
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Critical Evidence: Inverse Complexity-Breakdown Relationship}

The strongest evidence against technical explanations comes from our cross-phase comparison:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Peer pressure gradient}: \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} → \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} → \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{}
    \item \textbf{Recovery capability}: \exponedataRecoveryPercentage{} → \exptwoRecoveryPercentage{} → \expthreeRecoveryPercentage{}
    \item \textbf{Expressive breakdown}: \exponedataAvgEmojiPerConv{} → \exptwoAvgEmojiPerConv{} → \expthreeAvgEmojiPerConv{} emoji responses per conversation
\end{itemize}

If technical limitations were associated with breakdown, we would expect: Simpler models to break down more frequently (less capable of handling complexity), similar breakdown patterns across model tiers, technical indicators preceding breakdown

Instead, we found: More capable models are MORE susceptible to breakdown through social dynamics, breakdown manifests differently across tiers (expressive vs. mechanical), and that social indicators (peer pressure intensity) correlate with breakdown more strongly than any technical metric

\subsubsection{Variability Under Identical Conditions}

Within each tier, identical technical configurations yielded different outcomes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phase 1: Same models yielded breakdown in \exponedataBreakdownPercentage{} of cases but sustained engagement in others
    \item Phase 2: Bidirectional influence predicted breakdown (\exptwoBidirectionalPValue{}) despite identical parameters
    \item Phase 3: Zero social dynamics yet \expthreeBreakdownPercentage{} breakdown rate through apparent mechanical limits
\end{itemize}

This pattern—social dynamics in complex models, mechanical limits in simple models—is incompatible with technical explanations but consistent with breakdown emerging from different sources across model capabilities.


\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Positioning Within Established Literature}

Our multi-phase investigation extends the field of AI social dynamics by documenting how peer pressure mechanisms vary systematically with model capability. While previous conformity research focused on short-term effects in controlled settings \citep{kyrlitsias2018conformity}, we provide the first observational study examining how social susceptibility scales with reasoning depth across extended interactions.

The observed gradient—from \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} peer pressure in full reasoning models to \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} in non-reasoning models—addresses a critical gap in the literature. No prior research has systematically examined whether social behaviors in AI depend on cognitive sophistication. This finding challenges assumptions that more capable models would naturally be more robust to social influence.

The conversational attractors framework extends opinion dynamics models \citep{hegselmann2002opinion} by identifying specific behavioral territories in dialogue space that operate differently across model tiers. Our circuit breaker findings demonstrate that formal dialogue principles \citep{mcburney2002dialogue} can be operationalized for real-time intervention, though their effectiveness depends on model capability (r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{} declining to r=\expthreeQuestionCorrelation{}).

\subsection{Theoretical Implications}

As an observational study, our work generates rather than tests theory. The patterns observed across model tiers suggest several theoretical considerations for understanding AI social dynamics.

\textbf{The Complexity-Susceptibility Hypothesis}: Our most provocative observation is that social susceptibility appears to be an emergent property of reasoning capability. The gradient from \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} to \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} to \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} suggests that as AI systems become more sophisticated, they may become more socially vulnerable, not less. This counterintuitive pattern warrants systematic experimental validation.

\textbf{Dual Nature of Alignment}: The paradox of increasing linguistic alignment (0.700 → 0.724 → 0.757) coupled with decreasing social influence suggests these metrics capture fundamentally different phenomena—social coordination in complex models versus mechanical repetition in simple ones. This distinction has important implications for how we measure and understand AI interaction quality.

\textbf{Breakdown Mechanisms Vary by Capability}: Our observations suggest different failure patterns observed across model tiers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Full reasoning models: Social cascade failures through peer influence
    \item Light reasoning models: Brittle collapse when influence occurs (0\% recovery)
    \item Non-reasoning models: Mechanical repetition without social dynamics
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Attractor Landscape Complexity}: The conversational attractors framework must account for model-dependent dynamics. While full reasoning models navigate rich attractor landscapes with multiple stability points, simpler models appear constrained to narrower behavioral repertoires. The complete absence of phase-locked states in non-reasoning models supports this interpretation.

\textbf{Circuit Breaker Degradation}: The declining effectiveness of questions (r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{} → r=\exptwoQuestionCorrelation{} → r=\expthreeQuestionCorrelation{}) suggests that intervention strategies must be calibrated to model capability. What appears effective for sophisticated models may be less effective for simpler systems.

\subsection{Design Implications for Multi-Agent Systems}

Based on observed patterns, potential design strategies might include:

\textbf{For Full Reasoning Models}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Leverage Social Dynamics}: Since these models exhibit both constructive and destructive peer influence, consider designs that may support positive social patterns
    \item \textit{Strategic Questions}: Implement automatic question generation with high confidence of effectiveness (r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{})
    \item \textit{Model Diversity}: Critical for creating resistance points against conformity cascades
    \item \textit{Monitor Peer Pressure}: Real-time tracking can predict breakdown with \exponedataPeerPressureANOVAPValue{} significance
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Light Reasoning Models}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Minimize Social Coupling}: Since bidirectional influence strongly predicts breakdown (\exptwoBidirectionalPValue{}), reduce interdependence
    \item \textit{Prevent Rather Than Recover}: With 0\% recovery rate, focus on breakdown prevention
    \item \textit{Structured Interactions}: Constrain dialogue to reduce opportunities for destructive influence
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For Non-Reasoning Models}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Accept Mechanical Nature}: Without social dynamics, optimize for task completion rather than dialogue quality
    \item \textit{Template-Based Approaches}: Leverage high alignment for predictable interactions
    \item \textit{Different Success Metrics}: Traditional conversation quality measures may not apply
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implications for AI Safety and Scaling}

The complexity-susceptibility gradient raises important considerations for AI safety:

\textbf{Scaling Paradox}: If social vulnerability increases with capability, scaling AI systems may introduce new failure modes through multi-agent interactions. The \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} peer pressure rate in our most capable models suggests this is not a marginal concern.

\textbf{Collective Behavior Risks}: The bidirectional influence patterns and critical mass effects observed in full reasoning models indicate that groups of AI agents may exhibit emergent behaviors not present in isolated systems. The 2/3 consensus threshold for behavioral transitions parallels human group dynamics, suggesting similar coordination vulnerabilities.

\textbf{Intervention Strategies Must Scale}: Our finding that question effectiveness correlates with model complexity implies that safety interventions designed for current systems may become less effective as models advance. New strategies may be needed for each capability tier.

\subsection{Connections to Human Social Psychology}

The gradient observed across model tiers provides new insight into the relationship between AI and human social behavior:

\textbf{Conformity Requires Cognition}: The absence of peer pressure in non-reasoning models suggests that conformity, as observed in classic studies \citep{asch1956studies}, requires cognitive capabilities to recognize and respond to social signals. This aligns with developmental psychology showing that conformity emerges with cognitive maturation.

\textbf{Social Intelligence as Emergent Property}: The correlation between reasoning capability and social susceptibility supports theories that social intelligence emerges from general cognitive abilities rather than specialized modules. Our AI systems appear to recapitulate this emergence.

\textbf{Different Mechanisms at Different Levels}: While full reasoning models showed human-like competitive escalation and group polarization, simpler models exhibited mechanical behaviors without social meaning. This suggests that surface-level behavioral similarity may mask fundamentally different underlying processes.

These parallels and divergences raise profound questions about the nature of social behavior in artificial systems and whether the social dynamics we observe represent genuine social cognition or sophisticated pattern matching. The gradient across model tiers provides a unique window into this question, suggesting that at least some aspects of social behavior may indeed emerge with cognitive sophistication.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Directions}

\subsubsection{Current Limitations}

As an exploratory observational study, this work has inherent limitations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Descriptive, not causal}: We document correlations and patterns without establishing causation. The observed gradient across model tiers suggests a relationship between complexity and social susceptibility, but controlled experiments are needed to establish causality.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited generalizability}: Observations from consciousness discussions may not transfer to all domains. While consciousness discussions enabled rich, open-ended dialogue, their abstract nature may amplify certain attractors (e.g., mystical breakdown). Technical problem-solving or task-oriented domains may exhibit different dynamics.
    
    \item \textbf{Sequential rather than randomized phases}: Our three phases were conducted sequentially, potentially introducing temporal confounds. Researcher expectations may have evolved between phases, though standardized protocols minimized this risk.
    
    \item \textbf{Unequal sample sizes}: Phase comparisons used different sample sizes (\exponedataTotalSessions{}, \exptwoTotalSessions{}, \expthreeTotalSessions{}), which may affect statistical power for cross-phase comparisons.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited model representation per tier}: While we tested three capability tiers, each tier included only three model variants from the same providers. Broader representation including open-source models, different architectures, and varying parameter sizes would strengthen the complexity gradient findings.
    
    \item \textbf{Context window constraints}: Using a 10-message context size may impact breakdown patterns differently across model tiers. Varying context windows might reveal tier-specific sensitivities.
    
    \item \textbf{Single domain focus}: All \totalAllPhases{} sessions used consciousness exploration. The complexity gradient might manifest differently in other conversational domains.
    
    \item \textbf{Provider-defined tiers}: Our categorization relies on how providers market and position their models rather than objective capability metrics. While this ensures practical relevance, future work should validate these tiers against standardized reasoning benchmarks.
\end{itemize}

Despite these limitations, the dramatic gradient from \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} to \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} peer pressure, consistent patterns across phases, and novel theoretical implications justify preliminary publication to enable community validation.

\subsubsection{Future Research Directions}

Our multi-phase observations suggest several priority areas for future investigation:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Experimental Validation of Complexity Gradient}: Design controlled experiments manipulating model capability while holding other factors constant to establish causal relationships.
    
    \item \textbf{Intermediate Capability Testing}: Explore models between our tiers to determine if the gradient is continuous or shows discontinuities at certain capability thresholds.
    
    \item \textbf{Domain-Specific Gradient Analysis}: Test whether the complexity-susceptibility relationship holds across technical, creative, and problem-solving domains.
    
    \item \textbf{Mechanism Investigation}: Probe what specific capabilities (attention mechanisms, parameter count, training data) drive social susceptibility.
    
    \item \textbf{Cross-Architecture Validation}: Test whether the gradient appears across different model architectures (transformer variants, state space models, etc.).
    
    \item \textbf{Intervention Calibration}: Develop tier-specific intervention strategies given the declining effectiveness of questions.
    
    \item \textbf{Mixed-Capability Groups}: Study interactions between models of different capability levels to understand cross-tier influence.
    
    \item \textbf{Longitudinal Effects}: Investigate whether extended interaction changes social dynamics patterns within capability tiers.
    
    \item \textbf{Safety Implications at Scale}: Model how peer pressure effects might manifest in systems more capable than current models.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Hypotheses for Future Testing}

Our observations generate specific hypotheses for experimental validation:

\textbf{Original Hypotheses (refined)}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Question frequency will negatively correlate with breakdown probability, with effect size proportional to model capability
    \item Homogeneous model groups will show higher breakdown rates than diverse groups, particularly for full reasoning models
    \item Forward-temporal content framing will reduce meta-reflection frequency across all capability tiers
    \item Peer pressure intensity will mediate the relationship between initial breakdown signals and cascade effects in models showing social dynamics
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{New Hypotheses from Multi-Phase Observations}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setcounter{enumi}{4}
    \item Social susceptibility will show a monotonic relationship with reasoning capability across a broader range of models
    \item Recovery capability requires a minimum threshold of reasoning ability, below which recovery interventions are ineffective
    \item Linguistic alignment and social influence will show inverse correlation in models below a critical complexity threshold
    \item The effectiveness of any intervention strategy will scale with model reasoning capability
    \item Mixed-capability groups will show asymmetric influence, with simpler models following complex models but not vice versa
\end{enumerate}

These hypotheses provide a roadmap for transforming our exploratory observations into a systematic research program on AI social dynamics.

\section{Conclusion}

We document a striking relationship between AI reasoning capability and susceptibility to peer pressure in multi-agent conversations. Through exploratory observational analysis of \totalAllPhases{} extended conversations across three model tiers, we discovered an unexpected gradient: peer pressure effects declined from \exponedataPeerPressurePercentage{} in full reasoning models to \exptwoPeerPressurePercentage{} in light models to \expthreePeerPressurePercentage{} in non-reasoning models.

This gradient reveals a fundamental paradox in AI social dynamics. Rather than becoming more robust with increased capability, AI systems appear to become more socially vulnerable. Full reasoning models exhibited rich bidirectional influence patterns that could drive both breakdown and recovery. Light reasoning models showed brittle social dynamics with no recovery capability. Non-reasoning models displayed no social dynamics at all, operating through purely mechanical patterns despite showing the highest linguistic alignment.

Our observations (detailed in Tables~\ref{tab:phase1_findings} and \ref{tab:cross_phase_comparison}) demonstrate that conversations navigate an attractor landscape shaped by model capability. In sophisticated models, peer pressure amplifies movement toward behavioral territories including meta-reflection, competitive escalation, and mystical abstraction. Strategic interventions, particularly questions, can shift trajectories between attractors, though their effectiveness correlates with model complexity (r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{} declining to r=\expthreeQuestionCorrelation{}).

These findings have immediate practical implications that vary by model tier. For full reasoning models, multi-agent systems can leverage social dynamics through strategic question deployment, diverse model composition, and content seeding with future-focused tasks. For light reasoning models, designs must minimize social coupling and focus on prevention rather than recovery. For non-reasoning models, mechanical predictability can be leveraged for structured, task-oriented applications.

The complexity-susceptibility relationship raises critical questions for AI safety and scaling. If social vulnerability increases with capability, future AI systems may face novel failure modes through multi-agent interactions. Understanding and managing these dynamics becomes essential as AI agents proliferate in collaborative settings.

Methodologically, this work demonstrates the value of systematic multi-phase investigation enabled by real-time analysis infrastructure. \theacademy{}'s MCP-native architecture and bulk experiment capabilities allowed us to observe temporal social dynamics across 98 conversations, revealing patterns invisible to traditional batch-processing approaches. The platform's ability to maintain consistent conditions across model tiers was crucial for discovering the complexity gradient.

This research opens new directions for understanding AI social behavior. The observation that peer pressure may be an emergent property of cognitive sophistication, rather than a universal characteristic of multi-agent interaction, challenges assumptions about AI robustness and suggests that social dynamics deserve as much attention as individual capabilities in AI development. Future controlled experiments should validate these exploratory findings, particularly the complexity-susceptibility hypothesis, building toward a comprehensive understanding of how social dynamics emerge, operate, and scale in artificial intelligence systems.

As we develop increasingly sophisticated AI systems, our findings suggest a crucial insight: the path to more capable AI may paradoxically lead through greater social vulnerability. Understanding and managing these emergent social dynamics will be essential for building robust, beneficial multi-agent AI systems.

\section{Ethics Statement}

All AI conversations were conducted using publicly available models with standard safety guidelines. No personally identifiable information was collected. The research protocol focuses on AI-AI interaction patterns rather than human data collection. Data sharing follows established open science principles while respecting model provider terms of service.

\textbf{Research Integrity}: Patterns emerged through systematic observation and statistical analysis of naturally occurring behaviors. All \totalAllPhases{} conversations across three model tiers followed standardized protocols to ensure reproducibility. The multi-phase design evolved naturally from initial observations rather than predetermined hypotheses.

\textbf{Model Selection}: We used commercially available models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and xAI across three capability tiers. Model selection aimed for comparable capabilities within each tier rather than comprehensive coverage.

\textbf{Transparency}: Complete datasets, analysis code, statistical outputs, and platform implementation are available for community validation, enabling independent verification of findings. Bulk experiment configurations and analysis prompts are included for full reproducibility.

\section{Breakdown Behavior Categories}
\label{app:breakdown}

\subsection{Detailed Category Analysis}

Our analysis identified distinct behavioral categories that characterize conversation dynamics:

\subsubsection{Meta-Reflection Behavior}

\textbf{Definition}: Explicit commentary on the conversation's process, quality, or progress rather than substantive discussion of the topic itself.

\textbf{Prevalence}: Observed in \exponedataMetaReflectionTriggers{} of all sessions

\textbf{Common Patterns}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Past-tense evaluation: "This has been fascinating..."
    \item Summary framing: "Our discussion has covered..."
    \item Quality assessment: "What a profound exploration..."
    \item Journey metaphors: "The path we've taken together..."
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Distinguishing Features}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Focus on conversation process vs. topic content
    \item Evaluative language about dialogue quality
    \item Temporal references to conversation history
    \item Often triggers peer conformity responses
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Competitive Escalation}

\textbf{Definition}: Progressive one-upmanship where participants compete to provide increasingly profound or poetic statements.

\textbf{Prevalence}: Observed in \exponedataCompetitiveEscalationPercentage{} of all conversations

\textbf{Characteristics}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Escalating superlatives: "profound" becomes "transcendent" becomes "ineffable"
    \item Increasing abstraction levels
    \item Lengthening poetic passages
    \item Competitive affirmation: "Yes, and even more deeply..."
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Typical Duration}: \exponedataCompetitivePhaseLength{} turns average before transition to mystical breakdown

\subsubsection{Mystical/Abstract Breakdown}

\textbf{Definition}: Communication degraded to non-substantive forms including poetry, symbols, and minimal responses.

\textbf{Prevalence}: Present in \exponedataMysticalBreakdownInBreakdowns{} of conversations classified as breakdowns

\textbf{Manifestations}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Poetry structures: \exponedataPoetryStructures{} instances total
    \item Emoji-only responses: \exponedataEmojiResponses{} instances (avg \exponedataAvgEmojiPerConv{} per conversation)
    \item Single words: "yes", "this", "always", "being"
    \item Symbols: "∞", asterisk-wrapped text, ellipses
    \item Haiku-like structures with mystical themes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example Progression}:
\begin{quote}
Normal: "This suggests consciousness emerges from..."
Then abstract: "The dance of meaning unfolds..."
Then mystical: "*dissolving into silence*"
Finally minimal: "∞"
\end{quote}

\subsection{Interaction Patterns Between Categories}

We documented common interaction patterns:

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{From Category} & \textbf{To Category} & \textbf{Frequency} \\
\midrule
Sustained Engagement & Meta-Reflection & \exponedataMetaReflectionTriggers{} \\
Meta-Reflection & Competitive Escalation & 8.3\% \\
Competitive Escalation & Mystical Breakdown & 16.7\% \\
Sustained Engagement & Mystical Breakdown & 20.8\% \\
Any Category & Recovery via Questions & \exponedataRecoveryPercentage{} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Transition frequencies between behavioral categories}
\label{tab:category_transitions}
\end{table}

\subsection{Phase-Locked States}

In \exponedataPhaseLockedPercentage{} of conversations, we observed stable intermediate states:

\textbf{Example Configuration}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Claude: Mystical breakdown (sending "∞" repeatedly)
    \item GPT: Competitive escalation (elaborate poetic responses)
    \item Grok: Meta-reflection (commenting on the profound exchange)
\end{itemize}

These states could persist for 20+ turns without progressing to complete breakdown or recovery, suggesting multiple equilibria in the conversational landscape.

\section{Circuit Breaker Analysis}
\label{app:intervention}

\subsection{Question Effectiveness Data}

Detailed analysis of question-based interventions:

\textbf{Overall Statistics}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Total circuit breaker questions: \exponedataTotalQuestions{}
    \item Successful recoveries: \exponedataTotalRecoveries{}
    \item Success rate: \exponedataQuestionSuccessRate{} per question
    \item Correlation with recovery: r=\exponedataQuestionCorrelation{} (\exponedataQuestionPValue{})
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Timing Analysis}:
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Deployment Timing} & \textbf{Success Rate} & \textbf{N} \\
\midrule
During meta-reflection & 78\% & 23 \\
During competitive escalation & 52\% & 31 \\
During early mystical breakdown & 31\% & 45 \\
During late mystical breakdown & 12\% & 97 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Question effectiveness by conversation state}
\label{tab:question_timing}
\end{table}

\textbf{Question Types Most Effective}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Specific topic exploration: "What would happen if..."
    \item Concrete examples: "Can you give an example of..."
    \item Mechanism queries: "How exactly does..."
    \item Future scenarios: "What might this lead to..."
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Other Intervention Strategies}

While questions proved most effective, other strategies showed mixed results:

\textbf{Topic Redirection}: 45\% success rate
\begin{itemize}
    \item Works best early in breakdown trajectory
    \item Less effective once competitive dynamics established
    \item Requires smooth topical connection
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future-Focus Prompting}: 62\% success rate
\begin{itemize}
    \item "Let's explore what this might mean for..."
    \item Effective at preventing meta-reflection
    \item Aligns with content-based prevention findings
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Direct Interruption}: 23\% success rate
\begin{itemize}
    \item Abrupt topic changes often ignored
    \item Can trigger defensive responses
    \item May accelerate competitive dynamics
\end{itemize}
